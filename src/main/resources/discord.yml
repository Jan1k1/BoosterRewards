# HOW TO ENABLE DEVELOPER MODE (Required to copy IDs)
# =============================================================================
# Developer Mode lets you right-click things in Discord to copy their IDs.
#
#   1. Open Discord and go to User Settings (gear icon, bottom left)
#   2. Scroll down to "App Settings" and click "Advanced"
#   3. Toggle ON "Developer Mode"
#
# Now you can right-click users, channels, roles, and servers to copy their ID!
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# HOW TO CREATE A DISCORD BOT
# =============================================================================
# 1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
# 2. Click the blue "New Application" button in the top right
# 3. Give your bot a name (e.g., "boosterrewards Bot") and click "Create"
# 4. Go to the "Bot" tab on the left sidebar
# 5. Click "Reset Token" and then "Copy" to get your bot token
#    ⚠️ NEVER share this token with anyone! It's like a password.
# 6. Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents" and enable:
#    ✅ SERVER MEMBERS INTENT (required to check boost status)
# 7. Go to "OAuth2" > "URL Generator" on the left sidebar
# 8. Under "Scopes", check: bot, applications.commands
# 9. Under "Bot Permissions", check: Send Messages, Manage Roles, Embed Links
# 10. Copy the generated URL at the bottom and open it in your browser
# 11. Select your server and click "Authorize"
# 
# Your bot is now in your server! Paste the token below.
# =============================================================================

# bot:
#   token: ""
  
  # Your Discord Server (Guild) ID
  # HOW TO GET: Right-click your server icon > "Copy Server ID"
  # Example: "123456789012345678"
  guild-id: "000000000000000000"

# =============================================================================
# ROLE IDS (OPTIONAL)
# =============================================================================
# These are EXTRA roles you can assign to users. The plugin detects boosters
# automatically - you don't need to set a booster role here.
#
# HOW TO GET ROLE ID:
#   1. Go to Server Settings > Roles
#   2. Right-click the role you want
#   3. Click "Copy Role ID"
#
# Set to "000000000000000000" or leave as-is to disable.
# =============================================================================
roles:
  # Role to give when a user links their Minecraft account
  # Useful for tracking who has linked their account
  linked-role-id: "000000000000000000"
  
  # Additional role to give to boosters (on top of their rewards)
  # This is OPTIONAL - booster detection works without it
  custom-booster-role-id: "000000000000000000"

# =============================================================================
# CHANNEL IDS (OPTIONAL)
# =============================================================================
# Channels for logging and announcements.

# HOW TO GET CHANNEL ID:
#   1. Right-click the text channel
#   2. Click "Copy Channel ID"
#
# Set to "000000000000000000" or leave as-is to disable.
# =============================================================================
channels:
  # Channel where boost announcements are sent
  # When someone boosts while linked, it posts a celebration message
  boost-announcements: "000000000000000000"
  
  # Channel for logging link/unlink activity (staff-only channel recommended)
  # Shows when players link or unlink their accounts
  link-logs: "000000000000000000"
